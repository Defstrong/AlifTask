# Installment Payments Service

This project is an example of implementing the "Installment Payments" service for a financial institution that has signed a contract with an online electronics store. Depending on the product category, the duration of the installment plan may vary. The range of installment plans is: 3-6-9-12-18-24 months. The online store has only three categories with the following installment plan durations:

- Smartphone: installment plan [3â€“9] months
- Computer: installment plan [3â€“12] months
- TV: installment plan [3â€“18] months

For each additional unit of the range, 3% will be added for smartphones, 4% for computers and 5% for TVs from the total amount of the product. For example, if a customer wants to buy a smartphone with an installment plan for 18 months for 1000 somoni, the total amount will be 1060 somoni (1000 somoni + 6%).

The project is written in C# and uses the following technologies:

- ASP.NET CORE web API
- XUnit for unit testing
